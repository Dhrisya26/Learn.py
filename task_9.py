  a) split it equally along horizontal.

  b) split it as 4 parts vertically.

  a) Find the ceil of the matrix.
  
  b) Find the floor of the matrix.

      (use the shape function for finding the shape & use the same random we created here for both the below operations.)

  a) Squeeze the random array and print the squeezed array and its shape.
  b) Expand the random array by one axis and print the expanded array and its shape.
